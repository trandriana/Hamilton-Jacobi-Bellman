# Numerical approximation of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations appearing in game theory

In this repository, we implement the numerical approximation of an **Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman** problem that appears in game theory. The numerical analysis is discussed in a more general framework in 

- [Numerical approximation of the value of a stochastic differential games with asymmetric information](https://doi.org/10.1137/19M1309997)
- [A probabilistic numerical scheme for an obstacle problem arising in game theory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00245-012-9175-z)

For the implementation, see the section **6.2 Numerical experiments** of [Numerical approximation of the value of a stochastic differential games with asymmetric information](https://doi.org/10.1137/19M1309997).
